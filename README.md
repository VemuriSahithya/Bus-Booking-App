# Bus-Booking-App

A user should be able to book seats in Bus depending on the availability of seats, route he/she wish to travel on specific date. 

Key highlights should be incorporated: 

Seat booking with Waitlist 

PNR number generation upon booking 

List report application with few filters to modulate data 

A user should be able to query with PNR number for current status. 

Cancellation of seats before 24 hours of travel using PNR search 

Upon cancellation waitlist should move up 

While booking Route and dates should be specified by user 

Basic hygiene validation like, booking date should be less than current date, age should be number, etc. should be adhered 

No need to go for e-payments page - Treat it as a COD, Cash during Travel 

NOTE: For Data Modelling CDS Views must be created and for User Experience, UI5 application must be created. Spend good time in Data Modelling as it should be one-time activity and setting a base for your application.
